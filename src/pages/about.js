    <h1>About ZoidBerg & ZoidStock</h1>
    <p>John A. Zoidberg, more commonly called Zoidberg, is a Decapodian who lives on Earth in a dumpster. He works at Planet Express as a doctor. He is usually terrible at his job, especially with human patients, and is very poor. Zoidberg can seemingly eat anything, even trash or other inedible objects. He is looked down upon and treated as scum by his coworkers and is infamous for his nasty stench. Zoidberg is often insulted and is sometimes called a crab or lobster instead of 'Decapodian'.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Long story short, who else would you want managing your stock portfolio than a crazy lobster doctor who smells like he eats garbage, and does?</p>
